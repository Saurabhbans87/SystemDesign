Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common software design problems. They offer templates for solving problems that can arise in various scenarios, making code more modular, flexible, and easier to understand and maintain. Design patterns fall into three main categories:

# Creational Patterns: 
Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
* Singleton
* Prototype
* Factory
* Abstract Factory
* Builder

# Structural Patterns: 
Focus on the composition of classes and objects, helping ensure that parts of a system are organized to make larger structures.
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

# Behavioral Patterns: 
Deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
